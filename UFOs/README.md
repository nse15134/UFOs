# UFOs

#Project Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to create an interactive webpage that will allow for user filtering and dynamic selections.  We want our end-user to be able to view the data they are most interested in and drill-down to different levels of granularity.  We encourage them to drill-down into the data table on the bottom by State, Shape, Date, City, and country.  They are able to see different in-depth comments by each UFO sighting.
