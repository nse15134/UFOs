# UFOs

# Project Overview  
The purpose of this project is to deploy a webpage that will allow users to interact and filter to the data that they would like to see.  We built out a dynamic webpage that will give the users the ability to filter to different UFO sighting accounts based on State, City, Country, Data and more.  They can see individual comments with more granularity around each UFO sighting.

## Results

When first viewing the webpage above, we can see a well-defined layour between the Title, the Nase Image, the granular text info about the UFO sightings, a Data Table, and dynamic filters on the bottom left.  


We can dive into the filters above.  Let's start with the 'Data Function.  If i want to look at UFO sightings that happened on '1/11/2020' then we can enter that date into the first text box and view the results.  Below:

We can see above that the data table is now only showing values for 1/11/2010.  As seen from above, we have a couple of different filter options to select from, let's try a few more!

I want to be able to look at only UFO sightings in California, simply typing in 'ca' will give us those values.  We can see the filters are very dynamic, quick, and easy to use.  We also have the ability to use mulitple filters at a time.  For example, lets look at UFO sightings in California on 1/9/2019.  All we have to do is navigate to the State and Date filter and apply the below.

We can see from above that there were 2 different UFO sightings that match that criteria!


## Summary
One drawback is the inability to have multiple values in one filter.  Ie., naming different states and date ranges in one selction.  Unfortunately, the filters on allow for 1 value at a time.  There is room for improvement there.  Also the ability to download the data points for futher analysis.
