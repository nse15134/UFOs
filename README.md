# UFOs

# Project Overview  
The purpose of this project is to deploy a webpage that will allow users to interact and filter to the data that they would like to see.  We built out a dynamic webpage that will give the users the ability to filter to different UFO sighting accounts based on State, City, Country, Data and more.  They can see individual comments with more granularity around each UFO sighting.

When first viewing the webpage above, we can see a well-defined layour between the Title, the Nase Image, the granular text info about the UFO sightings, a Data Table, and dynamic filters on the bottom left.
